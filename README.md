 <h2>STL-10 Dataset Overview 📸🔍</h2>
   
   <p>The STL-10 dataset is a widely-used image dataset designed for developing unsupervised feature learning,
    classification, and other machine learning tasks. It contains 10 classes of objects, each with numerous labeled
    images, making it ideal for training and testing models. The dataset includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5,000 labeled training images</li>
        <li>8,000 labeled test images</li>
        <li>100,000 unlabeled images for unsupervised learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 10 classes are: airplanes 🛩️, birds 🐦, cars 🚗, cats 🐱, deer 🦌, dogs 🐶, horses 🐴, monkeys 🐒, ships 🚢, and trucks 🚚.
    Each image is 96x96 pixels in size, providing a good balance between detail and computational efficiency.</p>
    <p>The STL-10 dataset is often used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of various machine learning
    models, particularly in the field of computer vision. Its diverse set of images and the inclusion of unlabeled
    data make it a valuable resource for researchers and developers alike.</p>
